## Design

Horror Vacui was designed with four key principles in mind: challenge, spontaneity, fairness, and otherworldly themes. Every mission should substantially challenge players' mechanical and attention skills, be unpredictable to the best of the author's ability, and at the end of it all be fair in such a way that frustration is from poor play and judgment, not from a lack of available options, strategies, or reasonable expectation - all while suspenseful and unsettling feelings haunt the narrative.

Horror Vacui will never make use of biome-specific enemies. Horror Vacui will never use overly punishing damage resistances as part of its enemy design, nor will it ever design enemies solely to counteract weapons or tools; it will use enemies first and foremost as a means to challenge strategy and skill.

## Enemies

### Glyphid Architect

A rarely spawning variant of the Glyphid Menace that shoots projectiles which spawn platforms created by the Engineer's platform gun. Its role is to disrupt player movement, entrap players in small spaces, and provide emergent gameplay systems by creating completely new terrain for players and enemies to encounter and utilize.

### Glyphid Bombardier

The Glyphid Bombardier is a yellowish Septic Spreader that spawns swarmers from its spawnshot projectiles. Its role is to distract players with the tides of swarmers produced. At moderate distances, the Bombardier will charge at players to melee strike them.

### Glyphid Scorcher

A large, red variant of the Septic Spreader that launches a wall of fire at players, attempting to drive them away from open holds.

### Glyphid Brute

The Glyphid Brute is a dull gray and lustrous black variant of the Glyphid Glasher that has a higher health pool and much quicker movement speed. Upon striking a player, it slows their movement by 50% for 2 seconds. Its role is to provide constant pressure by pushing the fighting frontlines around and being highly disprutive to player positioning.

### Glyphid Grunt

The bulk of enemy forces - small, nimble, and of respectable damage and health. Their role is to overwhelm the player with sheer numbers from multiple angles and to distract them from fighting more dangerous foes - or, to outright kill players while they are focused on something else.

### Glyphid Divider and Component

The Glyphid Divider is a lustrous red Sentinel that spawns only during swarms at varying distances and distributions. Its role is to spawn behind sealed walls and dead ends to dig through terrain and disrupt holds and bunkers. While alive, Glyphid Dividers spawn a small trickle of Glyphid Components. Upon death, they release several Components.

Glyphid Components are small red Sentinels that spawn only from a Divider's presence. They are relatively numerous and spawn in a smattered distribution. Their role is to catch players off guard and finish digging out terrain to destroy holds and bunkers, should the Dividers themselves die while digging.

### Glyphid Enforcer

A Glyphid Menace variant that fires a fan of fireballs at players to apply pressure in both open and enclosed spaces. Its burrowing ability ensures helps to ensure that it always keeps players on edge.

### Glyphid Firecracker

The Glyphid Firecracker appears as a white Glyphid Exploder, moving 70% faster than its typical red counterpart. They are notable for appearing at random in large groups of varying distance and distribution. Its role is to catch players off guard with their extremely high speed - especially during recovery periods - and kill them by detonating; they also seek to punish bunkering strategies where players sit in one fortified position and endure enemy onslaughts. They very rarely spawn during most of an announced swarm so that they cannot kill other enemies or aggravate players.

### Glyphid Oppressor

The Glyphid Oppressor is a heavily armored enemy invulnerable to most forms of damage from all angles except the rear. Compared to its standard (base game) counterpart, the Oppressor in Horror Vacui is faster, more agile, and less durable. Its role is to provide instantaneous pressure to force players out of safe positions and punish bunkers, but remains vulnerable to open spaces and good player maneuverability - things not possible inside Bunkers.

### Glyphid Knight

A veteran of the Praetorian acting as a contrast to the Oppressor. It boasts much higher damage, movespeed, and stun, along with being stun immune. The Knight's armor is weaker, it is weak to melee, its spit range is reduced, and it leaves no gas behind on death. Its main role is to work together with Brutes to break teams apart by virtue of guaranteed melee strikes and advancing the swarmfront forward.

### Glyphid Drone

The Glyphid Drone is an off-white Glyphid Grunt that spawns from Fester Nexuses and Fester Polyps. Its role is to provide a greater threat than Glyphid Spawn, and instantaneous pressure when a Fester Nexus is killed by a player or random mission occurrence.

### Glyphid Drone Slasher

The Glyphid Drone Slasher is a Slasher variant of the Glyphid Drone that spawns from Brood Nexuses created during the level building process.

### Glyphid Dreadnought Lacerator

The Dreadnought Lacerator is a larger, heavily armored boss enemy that spawns at random. Its role is to induce panic and split teams with its attacks, while boasting high health that makes removing its threat a team challenge.

### Glyphid Fester Nexus

The Glyphid Fester Nexus is a bright red variant of the Brood Nexus which respawns at random. Its role is to add very mild area denial and pressure, and sometimes outright block passageways. It spawns Glyphid Drones and Fester Nexus Polyps. The Fester Nexus itself loses health slowly and will eventually die, releasing numerous drones. The slowly declining health acts as a means to limit the total number of enemies the Fester Nexus can spawn to avoid frustrating players.

### Fester Nexus Polyp

The Fester Nexus Polyp is a sickly yellow variant of the Brood nexus which is spawned in a wide, random distribution by the Fester Nexus. It spawns Glyphid Drones at a steady pace while losing health whereupon death it will release numerous Drones. The Nexus Polyp loses health faster than its parent Fester Nexus, ensuring lulls and spikes in the amount of Drones while providing a safeguard against continual Drone spam that may annoy players.

### Glyphid Reaper

The Glyphid Reaper is an exceptionally large, white Bulk detonator that boasts higher health, much larger dig sizes, explosion sizes, stomp size and damage, and vastly more bomblet projectiles. However, its slow speed makes it less of an active threat and more of a passive one, as its large physical size and lingering presence makes it difficult for players to navigate narrow passageways and small rooms. Its role is passive area denial, instantaneous player pressure, and complete ruination of parts of the cave if care is not taken - including destroying bunkers. Skilled application of the Reaper's death explosion can be used to improve the cave or even wipe out very large groups of enemies.

### Mactera Bulwark

A tougher variant of the Mactera Trijaw that uses its explosive projectiles to apply aerial pressure to players, along with slowly chipping away at terrain or barriers that players have created.

### Naedocyte Nomad

A purple variant of the Naedocyte Breeder with lower health that rarely spawns at random during the course of a mission. Its primary role is to populate the cave with Naedocytes to distract players and challenge their weapon choices.

### Naedocyte Brawler

A large, yellow, and tougher variant of a Naedocyte Swarmer that only spawns during swarms. Its role is to distract players and potentially soak up damage meant for other threats.

### Naedocyte Twins (Fortifier and Minelayer)

The Naedocyte Twins are two boss breeders that always spawn simultaneously with the singular purpose of disrupting players by creating large swathes of sprouts - if special care is not taken to dispatch of the Twins quickly, they can singlehandedly create a loss condition.

**The Fortifier** is a dazzling yellow Naedocyte Breeder that quickly creates a solid, contiguous wall of Korlok Sprouts to obstruct paths and provide additional pressure. The sprouts commonly interact with Architect platforms, making them an unpredictable source of danger. Its upfront pressure allows the Minelayer to slip away and place surprises uncontested.

**The Minelayer** is a dull green Naedocyte Breeder that quickly darts around the environment in a random and uncoordinated manner, placing singular Korlok Sprouts in unexpected places to catch players off guard while they are distracted with the Fortifier's upfront pressure.

### Korlok Reticula

Korlok Reticula are slightly larger variants of the Korlok Sprouts spawned by the Korlok Tyrant-Weed Boss enemy. They exist to fill an unused niche of more numerous, lower health and lower damage stationary enemies that can be spawned in smaller spaces to surprise players.

### Lancer

A member of the Infector family that fires three cascading walls similar to the Lacerator's stomp attack. It was designed to punish 'creeping' strategies for clearing rooms, oftentimes forcing players out into dangerous situations just to kill the highly problematic Lancer.

### The Immortal

A large member of the Naedocyte family - the flying 'jellyfish' enemies that populate the caves at times; it only spawns once at the start of every mission and no others will spawn during the course of any given mission. Failsafe logic exists to ensure there is only ever one Immortal alive at a time. The Immortal is effectively immune to all methods of destruction or harm but any stun applied lasts twice as long with a resultant 10s cooldown and it can be slowed by status effects that incur movement penalties; the slows from status effects are unchanged.

The Immortal travels relatively slowly when near players, but its speed increases gradually to an extreme degree as players increase their distance from it. At random, the Immortal will 'teleport' across the cave to a spot near the players (by dying and then triggering the failsafe spawner) - originally a workaround fix for buggy behavior now made into a feature.

If players spend too long in close proximity to the Immortal they will take a substantial chunk of damage and be set on fire; Driller's 50% Fire Resistance armor mod necessitates that he be struck approximately three times to be set on fire and the afterburn deals less damage as well: an intended design choice to allow Drillers to focus on the numerous trash enemies without being constantly annoyed by The Immortal's presence.

During a swarm, The Immortal becomes drastically slower, immune to all stun, and turns purple to signify the change; effectively turning it into an easily avoidable enemy that may 'soft camp' certain spots of the cave without being an overbearing nuisance during frantic firefights; when a swarm is finished The Immortal reverts to its previously described characteristics. Attentive players can use the Immortal's color changes to note when a swarm is truly dying out.

The role of The Immortal is to be a persistent, disruptive threat that gently nudges players out of safety or outright frightens them with its sudden presence. It makes bunkers and godspots largely untenable because of its invincible nature, and does a good job of blocking suppressing fire from players while they are inside the small chokepoints formed by long, drilled tunnels - an otherwise unbeatable strategy.

The Immortal is not entirely a detrimental force: it regularly spawns orbs that drop a modest amount of health on destruction - this contrasts its otherwise obstructive nature and allows The Immortal to be a dynamic force in the outcome of missions.

### The Reacher

A large variant of the Cave Leech that heals slowly over time and has an extremely long reach for grabbing players. Its slower reaching speed and longer range serve to surprise and frighten players while testing their environmental awareness as the slow motion can be difficult to notice during frantic moments.

### Q'ronar Shellback and Tidelets

A tough and agile member of the Q'ronar family, this red behemoth launches itself around the cave while spawning a steady trickle of pressure from Q'ronar Tidelets. Its relatively unpredictable nature makes low elevations and shield holding much more dangerous.

The Q'ronar Tidelets themselves are blue Younglings, permanently coiled into a ball. Their purpose is to reduce the efficacy of shields and bunkers by violently displacing players; fortunately Tidelets are quickly dispatched by any brief period of concentrated gunfire.

## Swarms
