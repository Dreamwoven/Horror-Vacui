# Problem Entry Format
## [HV-0001] - [Overwhelming breeders and enemy spawners]
## Category: [Enemy-Specific]
## Severity: 5
## Discovery Date: [2025-11-16]
## Discoverer: Marco
## Affected Systems:

Enemies, enemy spawners


## Description
The amount of spawns should be limited, reduced or paced differently in order to be more manageable to fight with all of the other waves of enemies]
## Evidence/Observations

- [The spawner bugs, when combined you only need a couple of them in order to fill a room with a lot of enemies]
- [Some of the spawner bugs (like the breeders) don't need to be close to the players and can still generate a lot of enemies and take too much time to find and get rid of]

### Affected Player Experience:
Player frustration

## Root Cause Analysis
[Why is this happening? Reference specific JSON values, mutator chains, or game mechanics.]

## Potential Solutions (Optional)

### [Lower spawn rates]

- Description: By allowing less enemies to spawn, like them taking longer to deploy, only allowing them to spawn when they're near players or allowing less to spawn it can become more manageable
- Pros: [Spawner enemies can become more manageable, they take less time to kill before it becomes more overwhelming] 
- Cons: [Depending of how less the enemies become they can become too easy to fight or give more place to other annoying bugs to spawn]
- Implementation Complexity: [Medium/High]
