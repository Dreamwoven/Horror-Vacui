# Version History
Versioning History for Horror Vacui.
Given that development has occurred over the course of two years, some exact knowledge is lost.

## Pre-Alpha Builds
Horror Vacui's first versions were made after months of playing Hazard 5x2, x3, x4, etc. After one mission of Hazard 6x2, I determined that the 'commonly challenging' difficulty framework was not even remotely up to my standards for engaging gameplay.

### Hazard 6x2.5F
The very first version of Horror Vacui - Hazard 6x2 with increased spawn counts and spawn diversity - it was something of a loose experiment.

### Hazard F [Flux] (Formerly Fx2)
Hazard F started life as "Fx2" from following in the common naming scheme of other difficulties; it was changed to just "F" after I realized that the x2 distinction was meaningless given that there was no intention for there to be an "x1" variant - it would always have this amount of enemies. Hazard F's design philosophy of "vanilla-like, but unhinged" was derived from observing the design of Lx2 (Lunatic).

Hazard F had dozens of versions with none of the changes being properly documented.

### Hazard Q [Quake]
Hazard Q was created when it became clear that the vision I had for a 'perfect difficulty' was starting to outgrow the original design philosophy of Hazard F. From memory, Hazard Q primarily focused on pacing and nitra economy as players were just chewing through the challenge with the cheap resupplies.

Hazard Q had one version before being renamed to Karl's End as I found the name unsatisfactory.

Several versions were made, but their exact changes never documented. The name was abandoned as it felt lofty and 'cringe' for lack of a better term.

## Alpha Builds
The first Alpha versions showed me a stronger, more refined vision of what does and does not work for the kind of gameplay I expect.

The release of the first proper Horror Vacui Alpha made it clear to me that I needed a more robust and transparent changelog.
